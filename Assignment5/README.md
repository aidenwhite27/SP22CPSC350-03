#### References: Exceptions (https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/exceptions/)
##### Known Errors: The assignment is not complete, I am turning in what I have
##### so far. The AStack class is finished and should operate properly. It
##### resizes when the stack size reaches the size of the array and it throws
##### exceptions in pop() and topValue() if the stack is empty. The rest of the
##### assignment has not yet been implemented. The FileChecker class is meant to
##### read in a file from command line and analyze the delimiters by storing
##### them in stacks. The FileChecker would be instantiated in mainprogram.cpp,
##### which right now is only being used for diagnostics.
