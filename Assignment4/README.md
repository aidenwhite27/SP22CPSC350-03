### Files Submitted: Grid.h classicGrid.cpp main.cpp
#### References: Random generation (https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/rand/),
#### CPSC298 TicTacToe assignment, Canvas
##### Known Errors: A lot. The program is very deficient. There should be
##### 2 more .cpp files for doughnut and mirror mode, and the classicGrid
##### function definitions should be in Grid, which all 3 should inherit from,
##### and then they would only need to define the nextGeneration() method
##### which would be pure virtual. The output hasn't been developed beyond being
##### used for diagnostics. I could go on.
##### What it does successfully: It can create grids either from input file or
##### randomly via command line using overloaded constructor. The grids are
##### padded which is not displayed to the user. A second grid accurately
##### represents the next generation from the first grid. & a few other things.
